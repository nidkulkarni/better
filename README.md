# Better Software Login and Sign-Up App

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npx expo start` to start the project.

## Design Choices

- Used **Formik** for form handling and **Yup** for form validation.
- Included **password strength** indicator for better UX during sign-up.
- Implemented a **Remember Me** checkbox in the login form, which stores the email using **AsyncStorage**.
- Followed clean code principles, keeping components modular and reusable.

## Assumptions or Limitations

- The password strength indicator is basic, considering only password length.
- Formik handles the validation for fields, and AsyncStorage is used for saving the email.
